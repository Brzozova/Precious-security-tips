## Standard steps

1. Put your wireless card into monitor mode:
```
$ airmon-ng start wlan0
```
Monitor mode - allows your computer to listen to every wireless packet & optionally inject packets into a network
What the command actually does is it creates another interface called mon0, which you can see when you do iwconfig. 
This is the command that you probably didn't execute. If you did run it but you can't see mon0 afterwards, let us know what was the command's output.


2. Start packets capturing:
```
$ airodump-ng <options> mon0
```

3. Attempt to increase the number of IVs being captured:
```
$ aireplay-ng <options> mon0
```

4. Cracks the capture to extract the password:
```
$ aircrack-ng <options> <file>
```

### Useful commands

Kill other processes that are currently trying to use that network adapter
```
$ airmon-ng check kill
```

Capture packets to a file:
```
$ airodump-ng -w <file_name> --output-format <format_like_csv> mon0
```
