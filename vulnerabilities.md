## Types of vulnerabilities

* Operating System - found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
* (Mis)Configuration-based - stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
* Weak or Default Credentials - applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. 
   For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
* Application Logic - a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
* Human-Factor - leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.
