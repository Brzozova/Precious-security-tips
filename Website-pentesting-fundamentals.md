## Discover Favicon

1. Find favicon endpoint in page source
2. Curl to check md5 hash value
3. Check Favicon framework -> https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database

Example of curl:
```
$ curl https://<domain_name>/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
```

## Worth to check

To find endpoints:
* robots.txt
* sitemap.xml

To find frameworks versions:
* curl with verbose (-v)
* Wappalyzer

To find subdomains:
* https://crt.sh
* https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates
* Google dorking, eg:
```
-site:www.tryhackme.com site:*.tryhackme.com
```
* dnsrecon
* Sublist3r

Google Dorking:
* site:<domain_name> -> returns results only from the specified website address
* inurl:admin -> returns results that have the specified word in the URL
* filetype:pdf -> returns results which are a particular file extension
* intitle:admin -> returns results that contain the specified word in the title

### Tools

#### FFUF
Endpoints
```
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.0.138/FUZZ
```

Virtual Hosts
The above command uses the -w switch to specify the wordlist we are going to use. 
The -H switch adds/edits a header (in this instance, the Host header), we have the FUZZ keyword 
in the space where a subdomain would normally go, and this is where we will try all the options from the wordlist.
```
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.<domain_name>" -u http://<IP_address>
```
Add `-fs {size}` to list only records with most often used `size`.

#### DIRB
```
$ dirb http://10.10.0.138/ /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```
#### GOBUSTER
```
$ gobuster dir --url http://10.10.0.138/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

#### DNSRECON
```
$ dnsrecon -t brt -d <domain_name>
```

#### Sublist3r
```
$ ./sublis3r.py -d <domain_name>
```
